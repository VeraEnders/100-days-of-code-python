# Write a program that asks a user for a city that he grew up in 
# and the name of user's pet.
# The program combines those together and gives the user the name of his band.

#1. Create a greeting for your program.
print('Welcome to the Band Name Generator.')

#2. Ask the user for the city that they grew up in.
city = input("What's name of the city you grew up in?\n")

#3. Ask the user for the name of a pet.
pet_name = input("What's your pet's name?\n")

#4. Combine the name of their city and pet and show them their band name.
print('Your band name could be ' + city + ' ' + pet_name)

#5. Make sure the input cursor shows on a new line
